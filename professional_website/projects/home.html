                        <h3>Automated API to connect SignalVine</h3>
                        <p>
                            For my internship, I was a Software Engineer for Through The Maze (Logan UT).
                            I designed, developed, and implemented a web API that would specifically
                            automated the update of records to SignalVine. Also implemented all other
                            functionality that SignalVine's API normally allowed for such as program
                            enrollment, text messages, etc. The importance for this was to take the raw
                            data from the company's website's database and send it to SignalVine. The 
                            API is what formatted that data into a properly formed signature that 
                            SignaVine would accept. The API can be found on my github <a href="">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the API, I also redid their backend to include things such as 
                            checking for duplicates, form REGEX validation, validation of forms prior to
                            submission, and database updates for multiple submissions and for API returns.
                            While my focus was primarily back end, some front end was done using Wix(the 
                            company's hosting and website building tool).

                        <h3>Personal Concert</h3>
                        <p>
                            The idea that we (Jason Chio, Colby Robbins, and I) had was that we
                            wanted to build a dynamic LED lighting system that could be installed
                            into a car that will change according to music coming off the amp.
                            The main hardware that was used was an Arduino Pro Mini and a custom
                            built low band filter module. Additionally, we had a Bluetooth module
                            to connect to so that the lighting system could be controlled by
                            Bluetooth via Mobile device however, due to time constraints for the
                            class, we did not implement it at that time. Project video can be found

                        <h3>Machine</h3>
                        <p>
                            Machine is a collaborative tool that has an IM service and integrates
                            tools such as Trello, github, file management, and other tools that
                            are useful tools for teams. The original idea came from a project for my
                            Web Engineering II (back end development). At that time, I didn't see
                            any options like this available for Slack (2017) but have found since
                            then that Slack has integrated these essential development team tools.

                        <p>
                            I decided upon the name through inspiration from one of my favorite
                            albums, Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here." I am unsure at this point if
                            I want to pursue further development of this project.

                        <h3>Senior Project</h3>
                        <p>
                            I had an idea when I was working as a lighting technician of having a 
                            wireless solution for running DMX fixtures for setups that could use
                            static lighting. This idea that I had was then turned into a reality
                            when it came time to do my senior project. I built a wireless DMX 
                            controller using an Arduino with a BLE module and an iPad. More details
